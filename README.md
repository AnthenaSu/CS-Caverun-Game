# CS-Caverun-Game
CS Caverun is a turn-based grid game written in C that demonstrates structured program design, state-driven logic, complex rule simulation, and algorithmic problem-solving. This project uses enums, structs, and modular functions to represent entities, board state, player actions, and environmental mechanics.
